## Hey there! I'm [Tallha Mushtaq](https://tallha-mushtaq.vercel.app) 👋

### 💡 What I'm all about
I'm a senior software engineer with 4+ years of experience, specializing in frontend technologies while also skilled in backend development. I've got a bit of an eye for design too, which helps me create stuff that's not just functional, but looks pretty cool as well!

With a growth mindset, I'm a strong advocate of self-education, always trying to learn more about the things that interest me the most.

### 🌱 Currently exploring
- The deeper realms of AI/ML
- Working on a sass based chatbot product.

### 🛠️ My toolbox
```javascript
const mySkills = {
  frontend: ['React', 'Next.js', 'HTML', 'CSS', 'SASS'],
  backend: ['Express.js', 'Nest.js', 'SQL', 'Laravel'],
  languages: ['JavaScript', 'TypeScript', 'PHP'],
  tools: ['Docker', 'Git', 'CI/CD Pipelines']
};
```

### 💼 Some cool stuff I've done
- Extensive experience with in-demand frontend technologies like Next.js and React.js
- Contributed to multiple successful startups, driving thousands of dollars in revenue
- Built some nifty full-stack solutions
- Earned a Top Rated badge on Upwork (pretty chuffed about that!)
- Mastered the art of working in my pajamas (aka remote work)


### 🚀 What's next?
I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects and awesome people to collaborate with. Whether you're dreaming up the next big app or need to spruce up an existing one, I'm here to help make it happen!
